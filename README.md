## ‚ö†Ô∏è Modernization Status (November 2025)

**Phase 1 (Foundation & Build System) - IN PROGRESS**

The project is undergoing modernization from Java 8 + Restlet to Java 17 + Quarkus. Phase 1 build system updates are complete:

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Java 17 build configuration
- Quarkus 3.15.0 framework integration
- Archie 3.15.0 openEHR library integration
- BaseX 10.7 database library upgrade
- Updated Maven plugins and dependencies
- All dependencies now from Maven Central

‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Compilation Errors (Expected):**
The project currently does not compile - this is expected at the end of Phase 1. Compilation errors exist due to:
- Restlet framework code (to be migrated in Phase 3)
- Old openEHR library references (to be migrated in Phase 2)
- XMLBeans schema compilation (temporarily disabled)

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: Migrate openEHR library references to Archie
- Phase 3: Migrate Restlet REST endpoints to Quarkus JAX-RS

**Documentation:**
- üìÑ **[STATUS.md](STATUS.md)** - Quick overview of compilation issues
- üìã **[BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md](BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Step-by-step build guide
