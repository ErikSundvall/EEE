# Test Results Summary - LiU EEE Modernization Assessment

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Tested By:** GitHub Copilot Workspace Automated Assessment  
**Environment:** Java 17.0.16, Maven 3.9.11, Linux

---

## Executive Summary

The LiU EEE project, originally developed in 2013, **cannot be compiled or tested** in a modern environment (2025) without first resolving critical dependency issues. However, the project structure is intact and with proper dependency resolution, it should be recoverable.

## Tests Performed

### ✅ Test 1: Maven POM Validation
**Status:** PASS (after updates)  
**Actions Taken:**
- Updated repository URLs from HTTP to HTTPS
- Removed unreachable maven-restlet repository
- Validated POM XML structure

**Result:** POM is valid and Maven can parse it successfully.

---

### ✅ Test 2: Java Compiler Configuration
**Status:** PASS (after updates)  
**Actions Taken:**
- Updated source/target from Java 1.7 to 1.8
- Verified compatibility with modern JDK 17

**Result:** Compiler configuration is valid. Java 1.8 bytecode can run on Java 17.

---

### ❌ Test 3: Dependency Resolution
**Status:** FAIL  
**Attempted:** `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies`

**Missing Dependencies:**
1. **Restlet Framework (5 artifacts)**
   - org.restlet.jse:org.restlet:2.1.2
   - org.restlet.jse:org.restlet.ext.wadl:2.1.2
   - org.restlet.jse:org.restlet.ext.xml:2.1.2
   - org.restlet.jse:org.restlet.ext.json:2.1.2
   - org.restlet.jse:org.restlet.ext.freemarker:2.1.2

2. **openEHR Libraries (7 artifacts)**
   - openehr:openehr-rm-core:1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
   - openehr:openehr-rm-domain:1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
   - openehr:rm-builder:1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
   - openehr:openehr-aom:1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
   - openehr:adl-parser:1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
   - openehr:openehr-ap:1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
   - openehr:rm-skeleton:1.0.3-SNAPSHOT

3. **BaseX Database (5 artifacts)**
   - org.basex:basex:7.6
   - net.xqj:basex-xqj:1.2.0
   - com.xqj2:xqj2:0.1.0
   - javax.xml.xquery:xqj-api:1.0
   - org.basex:basex-api:7.6

**Result:** 17 critical dependencies unavailable in public Maven repositories.

---

### ❌ Test 4: Project Compilation
**Status:** FAIL  
**Command:** `mvn clean compile`

**Error:** XMLBeans plugin fails to compile XSD schemas

**Specific Errors:**
```
xml Error/home/runner/work/EEE/EEE/src/main/xsd/EEE-v1.xsd:66:4: 
error: src-resolve: type 'ORIGINAL_VERSION@http://schemas.openehr.org/v1' not found.

xml Error/home/runner/work/EEE/EEE/src/main/xsd/EEE-v1.xsd:157:4: 
error: src-resolve: type 'VERSION@http://schemas.openehr.org/v1' not found.
```

**Root Cause:** XML schemas reference openEHR types that are not available.

**Result:** Compilation fails before Java code is even processed.

---

### ❌ Test 5: Unit Tests
**Status:** FAIL (cannot run)  
**Command:** `mvn test`

**Result:** Tests cannot run because compilation fails.

**Test Files Found:**
- `src/test/java/se/liu/imt/mi/eee/AppTest.java` - Basic placeholder test

---

### ✅ Test 6: Source Code Analysis
**Status:** PASS  
**Method:** File system analysis

**Findings:**
- **103 Java source files** in src/main/java
- **1 Java test file** in src/test/java
- **8 XSD schema files** in src/main/xsd
- **Code appears syntactically valid** (manual inspection of samples)

**Result:** Source code structure is intact and appears valid.

---

### ✅ Test 7: Local Repository Check
**Status:** PASS  
**Location:** `repo/` directory

**Available Artifacts:**
- org.exist-db:exist:2.0 ✓
- org.exist-db:exist-optional:2.0 ✓
- org.exist-db:exist-xmldb:2.0 ✓
- org.xmldb:xmldb-api:unknown ✓
- openehr:rm-validator:1.0.2-SNAPSHOT ✓

**Result:** 5 dependencies available locally, but many more are missing.

---

### ✅ Test 8: Documentation Review
**Status:** PASS  

**Files Reviewed:**
- README.md - Updated with modernization warnings
- LICENSE.txt - Apache 2.0 (compatible with modernization)
- restserver.properties - Configuration file present

**Result:** Documentation provides context for the project's purpose and design.

## Code Quality Indicators

### Positive Indicators
✅ Consistent code structure  
✅ Well-organized package hierarchy  
✅ Configuration externalized (properties files)  
✅ Local repository pattern used for custom dependencies  
✅ Apache 2.0 license (permissive)  

### Areas of Concern
⚠️ No modern CI/CD pipeline  
⚠️ Very old dependencies (2012-2013 era)  
⚠️ Single basic unit test  
⚠️ No integration tests  
⚠️ Java 1.7 (very outdated)  
⚠️ Depends on deprecated/unmaintained frameworks

## Conclusion

The LiU EEE project is **recoverable but requires significant dependency resolution work** before it can be compiled and tested. The source code appears intact, and the project structure is sound. With the right effort, this project can be restored to working condition and potentially modernized for long-term sustainability.

### Key Takeaway

> **The project doesn't compile**, but comprehensive documentation has been provided (MODERNIZATION.md, BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md, STATUS.md) to guide recovery efforts.
