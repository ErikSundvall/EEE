## Notes

- This phase is about making the system production-ready and maintainable
- Many tasks are optional but recommended based on deployment needs
- Prioritize features based on actual requirements (educational vs production)

- Performance optimization should be data-driven (measure before optimizing)
- Security is not optional - implement at least basic hardening
- Monitoring and observability are essential for operations
- Consider long-term maintenance burden when adding features
- Native compilation is impressive but evaluate if worth the complexity
- Rate limiting may not be needed for educational use but good for public APIs
- Focus on features that improve developer experience and system reliability
- Production readiness is a journey, not a destination (continuous improvement)
- Document all enhancements for future maintainers
- Consider what will be maintained long-term vs what's experimental
- Get feedback from actual users and iterate
- Celebrate the completion of the modernization!
