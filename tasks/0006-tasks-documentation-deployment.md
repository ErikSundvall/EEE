# Task List: Phase 6 - Documentation & Deployment

**Related PRD**: [0001-prd-liu-eee-modernization.md](0001-prd-liu-eee-modernization.md#phase-6-documentation--deployment-week-4)

**Goal**: Create comprehensive documentation for the modernized system and set up deployment infrastructure including Docker, CI/CD, and deployment guides.

**Estimated Effort**: Week 4 (40 hours)

### Notes

- Documentation should be clear, comprehensive, and maintainable
- Target multiple audiences: students, developers, educators, maintainers
- Use diagrams where helpful (architecture, workflows)
- Keep documentation close to code (use Markdown in repository)
- OpenAPI/Swagger provides API documentation automatically
- Docker enables consistent deployment across environments
- CI/CD automates testing and quality checks
- Good documentation reduces support burden

## Notes

- Documentation is a continuous process, not one-time effort
- Keep documentation close to code (in repository)
- Use simple, clear language - avoid jargon where possible
- Include examples and visuals where helpful
- Documentation should be version-controlled with code
- Consider documentation as a first-class deliverable
- Good documentation reduces support burden significantly
- Update documentation when code changes (in same PR/commit)
- CI/CD ensures code quality and consistency
- Docker simplifies deployment across different environments
- OpenAPI/Swagger provides interactive API documentation
- Consider documentation hosting (GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs, etc.)
- Collect feedback on documentation quality and iterate
