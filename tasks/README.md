## How to Use These Task Lists

### For Project Managers
1. Review each phase's estimated effort
2. Understand dependencies between phases
3. Track progress through checklist completion
4. Monitor acceptance criteria achievement

### For Developers
1. Start with Phase 1 (foundation is required for later phases)
2. Work through tasks in each major group sequentially
3. Check off completed subtasks as you progress
4. Refer to "Relevant Files" section for implementation targets
5. Review "Notes" section for implementation guidance
6. Verify "Acceptance Criteria" before moving to next phase

### For Code Reviewers
1. Use task checklists to verify completeness
2. Check that acceptance criteria are met
3. Ensure dependencies are satisfied before approving phase completion

## Task List Format

Each task list includes:

### Sections
1. **Goal** - Overall objective of the phase
2. **Relevant Files** - Files that will be modified
3. **Tasks** - Hierarchical checklist of work items
4. **Acceptance Criteria** - Criteria for phase completion
5. **Dependencies** - Prerequisites and blocked phases
6. **Notes** - Implementation guidance and best practices

### Task Numbering
- Major tasks: `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`, etc.
- Subtasks: `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3`, etc.

### Checkboxes
- `- [ ]` - Not started
- `- [x]` - Completed
- Check off tasks as you complete them

## Dependencies Between Phases

```
Phase 1 (Foundation)
    ↓
    ├─→ Phase 2 (openEHR Migration)
    │       ↓
    ├─→ Phase 3 (REST Migration) ←─┘
    │       ↓
    └─→ Phase 4 (Database) ←────┘
            ↓
        Phase 5 (Testing) ←────────┘
            ↓
        Phase 6 (Documentation)
            ↓
        Phase 7 (Enhancement & Polish)
```

**Critical Path**: Phases 1-6 must be completed sequentially. Phase 7 can run partially in parallel with Phase 6.
